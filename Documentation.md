# AutoML

## Introduction 

### Definition
According to [Wikipedia's formal definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning#:~:text=Automated%20machine%20learning%20(AutoML)%20is,combination%20of%20automation%20and%20ML), Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. So, it is a combination of automation and machine learning (ML).

### Difference between AutoML and Traditional ML
Then comes a natural question: Why do we already have a high technique - machine learning- and why do we still want to automate the process? How does auto machine learning differ from traditional machine learning? It lies in the following three points:
- **Automation vs. Manual Effort:** AutoML automates almost every part of the workflow, while traditional ML requires manual intervention at each stage.
- **Standardization vs. Flexibility in Deployment:** AutoML typically works well for common and standardized tasks because AutoML platforms often come with deployment options, enabling quick integration, while traditional ML allows for greater flexibility to craft custom models and requires more custom deployment strategies in specific use cases, which can involve significant DevOps resources.
-  **Expertise and Cost:** AutoML reduces dependency on highly skilled data scientists, allowing for a smaller team on the project, while traditional ML often requires hiring specialized talent, increasing the cost of a project.

### AutoML Process
AutoML and traditional machine learning both play essential roles in the data science landscape. AutoML democratizes machine learning, making it accessible to more people and enabling faster, automated solutions for common problems. On the other hand, traditional machine learning provides flexibility and control, making it ideal for complex or unique problems that require expert intervention. The choice between the two depends on the specific use case, available resources, and the desired trade-off between speed, customization, and performance.
1.	**Data Preparation:** This stage involves cleaning raw data by handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables. AutoML systems may also detect data types (e.g., numerical or categorical) and suggest suitable transformations to make the dataset machine-learning-ready.
2.	**Feature Engineering:** AutoML feature engineering automates the process of transforming features to enhance model performance. It applies techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and various transformations that improve feature relevance. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on human expertise, AutoML uses algorithms to select or create new features automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention. These optimizations are often guided by meta-learning, which leverages prior knowledge to identify useful transformations and combinations, streamlining the feature engineering process and enhancing predictive outcomes efficiently.
3.	**Model Selection:** Multiple algorithms are tested to find the most suitable one for the task (e.g., classification or regression). AutoML platforms often perform ensemble learning, where several models are combined to improve accuracy.
4.	**Hyperparameter Tuning:** AutoML optimizes hyperparameters automatically using techniques like grid search, Bayesian optimization, or genetic algorithms. This ensures that the selected model performs as efficiently as possible without manual intervention.
5.	**Deployment:** Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed in real-world applications. AutoML systems may offer built-in deployment tools, such as APIs, and provide mechanisms to monitor model performance and detect issues like concept drift, where model performance deteriorates over time due to changing data patterns.

## Why AutoML is Important

The rise of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has played a pivotal role in democratizing access to machine learning, allowing individuals who possess valuable domain knowledge but lack technical expertise in data science to participate actively in this field. By automating critical steps such as data preparation, feature engineering, and model selection, AutoML enables non-experts to develop machine learning models. This facilitates the resolution of important problems without the necessity for advanced technical skills, thereby expanding the contributions of diverse individuals in the machine learning landscape.

Moreover, the reliance on specialized data scientists is diminished, allowing a wider array of businesses to leverage machine learning technologies. This shift not only streamlines the integration of machine learning into various operational workflows but also enhances the availability of these techniques across multiple industries. As a result, machine learning can serve as a powerful tool for organizations seeking to innovate and maintain competitive advantages.

In terms of fostering innovation, the user-friendly nature of AutoML encourages broader participation in tackling complex challenges, such as image recognition and natural language processing. The increased accessibility empowers a greater number of individuals to contribute their insights, leading to the emergence of new ideas and solutions. Organizations benefit from tapping into the expertise of domain specialists who may lack extensive technical skills, enriching the problem-solving process.

AutoML also significantly enhances efficiency by streamlining the model development process for tasks like predictive analytics and image recognition. The automation of repetitive tasks, such as data preparation and hyper-parameter tuning, results in quicker and more reliable outcomes. This time-saving aspect allows teams to focus on larger strategic initiatives and expedites decision-making processes, ultimately boosting overall productivity.

Ultimately, AutoML represents a transformative approach that democratizes access to machine learning, mitigates skill barriers, and promotes innovation across various industries. Its impact is evident in the enhanced efficiency and effectiveness with which organizations can harness machine learning to address complex challenges, contributing to a more data-driven decision-making environment.

## Comparison Between Different Libraries
Intro of the pros and cons of each tool:

First, we will discuss the AutoML platforms Google AutoML and H2O.ai.

This versatility in handling both tabular and image data, as well as its integration with Google Cloud sets Google AutoML apart from its competitors. However, Google Cloud does have its drawbacks. First, this is not a free platform, so it is likely infeasible to use it for non-commercial, small-scale projects. Further, limited on-premises deployment options can be a problem for organizations with set data privacy concerns. 

H2O.ai is an open-source AutoML platform that is capable of both on-premises and cloud deployment. The platform provides a suite of tools and services including AutoML, Grid Search and Model Management. Further, the platform is highly extendable, where users can easily incorporate custom Python code. This feature does cause a steeper learning curve for beginners, which can inhibit ease of use. In addition, there is limited support for deep learning and specialized tasks.  

Next, we will take a look at the Auto-Sklearn and Microsoft Azure AutoML.
